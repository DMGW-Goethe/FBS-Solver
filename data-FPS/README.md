### These folders contain the raw data used to create the figures in the paper "Fermion Proca Stars: Vector-Dark-Matter-Admixed Neutron Stars": https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17291 (published in the "MDPI Particles" journal)

### All figures can be recreated using the python plotting scripts included in this repository
### The data itself can be generated using the cpp code

### The difference between the files marked with "powerlaw" and without is the spacing in the initial conditions (central density and field amplitude)

### If not specified otherwise, all data files are of "fermion Proca stars" (with the vector field). Cases with the scalar field have "FBS" in their filenames

### Some files are present in multiple folders for ease of finding the data relevant to each figure
