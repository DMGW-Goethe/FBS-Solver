# FBS solver:

## Overview:

The code is written in C++, Cython and Python. 
The C++ part models the FBS star, integrates the differential equations involved and writes the results to files.
There is also a cython wrapper included that wraps the C++ code in a more user friendly python experience and does simple plots. 
Lastly, there is a some python functionality for reading out the solutions generated by the C++ code, generating the stability curves and much prettier plots.

To compile, a call to 

    make

should suffice.

To obtain the data and plots of the paper we used this file.

In case dependencies are needed

    sudo apt install libboost-dev
    pip3 install numpy matplotlib cython

## The C++ structure

The file structure is as follows:
 - `vector.hpp`: Defines a simple wrapper of a boost::vector for (mathematical) vectors
 - `integrator.hpp`: Includes a Runge-Kutta-45-Fehlberg integrator that is accurate to 5th order with variable step size. The integrator allows to define events with an event_condition that will be checked for during the integration 
 - `eos.hpp`: Defines a model for different Equations of State. Preimplemented are a Polytropic EoS and a Causal EoS. Additional EoS can be read from files.
 - `nsmodel.hpp`: Describes most of the logic for an FBS. The FermionBosonStar class includes the logic for an FBS in equilibrium, while the FermionBosonStarTLN class extends the functionality to pertubations as described in the paper. The general idea is to first create a FermionBosonStar instance and integrate the equilibrium state, and from there create an instance of the TLN class to extend the computation.
 - `mr_curves.hpp`: Defines functions to calculate lists of FBS with OMP support and write them to file.
 - `plotting.hpp`: Allows to plot single integrations of stars. Only for debugging purposes, superseeded by the pyfbs implementation.
 - `matplotlibcpp.hpp`: For aforementioned debugging purposes. Generally not used, only if specified in Makefile. Does not work together with pyfbs. See at the end for more info.

See the `main.cpp` for some examples of how to integrate a single star, or create an MR-curve.

## The pyfbs structure

The pyfbs module contains a wrapper for the C++ files described above. This makes quick calculations and plots of single stars and curves much easier.
See the `pyfbs/TestFBS.ipynb` file for some examples.
Unfortunately, the cython wrapper (< version 3) misses some functionality, so usage requires modification of the cython library files as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67626270/inheritance-and-stdshared-ptr-in-cython).

## The python files

These files are for loading a file written by the mr_curves.hpp functions, calculating the stability curves and making pretty plots out of them. 
See `python/plotting.ipynb` for some examples.
